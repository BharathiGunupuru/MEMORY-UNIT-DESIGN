# MEMORY-UNIT-DESIGN
Designed a dual-port memory unit in VHDL with 1024x16-bit storage, supporting simultaneous write and read operations using independent clocks. The design includes asynchronous resets, write-enable control, and a read-valid signal. Verified functionality via a testbench with multiple write/read cycles and invalid address handling.
